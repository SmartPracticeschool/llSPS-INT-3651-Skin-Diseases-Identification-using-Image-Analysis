			  <h3><font color="white">Skin Disease Identification Using Image Analysis</h3>
			  <br>
			  <p><font color="white">skin disease is one of the most problem facing by us for a sample thing we need to consult doctor,to know which type of disease it is.In our busy schedule we are unable to visit doctor,so we will become careless which can become a problem in future.If we are not taking it as serious it may spread to others also.So,to reduce the burden in our busy schedule we developed this project.If we take the image of our disease and upload here then it will tell us the which type of disease it is.Skin diseases are more common than other diseases. Skin diseases may be caused by fungal infection, bacteria, allergy, or viruses, etc. The advancement of lasers and Photonics based medical technology has made it possible to diagnose the skin diseases much more quickly and accurately. But the cost of such diagnosis is still limited and very expensive. So, image processing techniques help to build automated screening system for dermatology at an initial stage. The extraction of features plays a key role in helping to classify skin diseases. Computer vision has a role in the detection of skin diseases in a variety of techniques. Due to deserts and hot weather, skin diseases are common in Saudi Arabia. This work contributes in the research of skin disease detection. We proposed an image processing-based method to detect skin diseases. This method takes the digital image of disease effect skin area, then use image analysis to identify the type of disease. Our proposed approach is simple, fast and does not require expensive equipment other than a camera and a computer. The approach works on the inputs of a color image. Then resize the of the image to extract features using pretrained convolutional neural network. After that classified feature using Multiclass SVM. Finally, the results are shown to the user, including the type of disease, spread, and severity. The system successfully detects 3 different types of skin diseases with an accuracy rate of 100%.
